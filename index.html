        <h1>The Wind that Blew like Singing Frogs</h1>
        <p>A Short Story</p>

        <p>
            Jane Doe was thinking about Khabikf Moons again. Khabikf was an adorable lover with sloppy eyes and ample lips.</p>

        <p>
            Jane walked over to the window and reflected on her beautiful surroundings. She had always loved magical Athens with its obnoxious, orange oceans. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel confident.</p>

        <p>
            Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the adorable figure of Khabikf Moons.</p>

    <div class="kozuka">
        <h2>..continued</h2>

        <p>
            Jane gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a courageous, gracious, tea drinker with brown eyes and pretty lips. Her friends saw her as a frantic, fluttering friend. Once, she had even rescued a shivering toddler from a burning building.</p>
        <p>
            But not even a courageous person who had once rescued a shivering toddler from a burning building, was prepared for what Khabikf had in store today.</p>

        <p>The wind blew like singing frogs, making Jane anxious. Jane grabbed a stripy teapot that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.</p>

    <div class="gotham">
        <h2>..continued</h2>

        <p>
            As Jane stepped outside and Khabikf came closer, she could see the dangerous smile on his face.</p>

        <p>
            Khabikf gazed with the affection of 1081 loving barbecued bears. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want affection."</p>

        <p>
            Jane looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the stripy teapot. "Khabikf, you must think I was born yesterday," she replied.</p>

        <p>
            They looked at each other with delighted feelings, like two grieving, gentle gerbils thinking at a very caring holiday, which had classical music playing in the background and two funny uncles laughing to the beat.</p>

    <div class="raleway">
        <h2>..continued</h2>
        <p>
            Jane regarded Khabikf's sloppy eyes and ample lips. "I feel the same way!" revealed Jane with a delighted grin.</p>

        <p>
            Khabikf looked happy, his emotions blushing like a shrill, scandalous sausage.</p>

        <p>
            Then Khabikf came inside for a nice cup of tea.</p>

        <p>THE END </p>

        <p>Hope you enjoyed</p>
